# MadChess
UCI Chess Engine

## Status

I am in the process of porting my C# chess engine from a mailbox board representation (version 2.x) to bitboards (version 3.0).  This 3.0 bitboard version of MadChess is in beta at the moment.  I do not plan to release it until it's significantly stronger than MadChess 2.x.

Track progress of MadChess 3.0 Beta on my chess programming blog, https://www.madchess.net.
